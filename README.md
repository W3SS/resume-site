======
**mzrimsek.github.io** is my personal website. You will most likely find it under [zrimsek.com](http://zrimsek.com).

## Domains
* see [CNAME](https://github.com/mzrimsek/mzrimsek.github.io/blob/master/CNAME) file

## Technology
* Jade
* SASS
* Bootstrap
* FontAwesome
* Material Design Lite
* jQuery
* AngularJS
* [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)

## TODO
* New profile picture
* Some other cool stuff

## Notes
* The site works by redirecting from a dummy index.html in the root of the repo to the dist subfolder where the real project root is.
* Normally I would just commit these files, but for the intent of showing off SASS/Jade/Gulp usage, all files that are used for local development are committed, not just the results of their compilation.
